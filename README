About
=====

Most applications in Android Market use native binaries, those
built with help of Android NDK. And almost every developer build
native binaries only for armeabi target.

Since I got mips-based "china-phone" I need applications for it.
Fortunatelly those which are open-source are only need to be rebuilt
with mips NDK to make them work.

So here will .apk's reside built for mips target. (not mips-r2).
